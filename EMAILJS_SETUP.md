## Security Notes
- The public key is safe to expose in frontend code
- EmailJS handles the actual email sending securely
- No sensitive email credentials are stored in your frontend

## Troubleshooting
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify all IDs and keys are correct
- Ensure the destination email is valid
- Check EmailJS dashboard for sending logs
