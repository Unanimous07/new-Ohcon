2. Find your **Public Key** (starts with something like `user_...` or newer format)
3. Copy this key

## 5. Configure Environment Files

### For Development (src/environments/environment.ts):
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  emailjs: {
    serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID_HERE',        // From step 2
    templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE',      // From step 3  
    publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE'         // From step 4
  },
  api: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4200'
  }
};
```

### For Production (src/environments/environment.prod.ts):
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  emailjs: {
    serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID_HERE',        // Same as development
    templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID_HERE',      // Same as development
    publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE'         // Same as development
  },
  api: {
    baseUrl: 'https://ohconmw.org'           // Your production domain
  }
};
```

## 6. Set Up Destination Email
Configure the email address where contact form submissions should be sent:

1. In your EmailJS template, set the destination email in the "To Email" field
2. Use: `info@ohconmw.org` or your preferred OHCON email address
3. Make sure this email address can receive messages

## 7. Test the Configuration

### Development Testing:
1. Run `ng serve`
2. Go to contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your destination email for the message
5. Check browser console for any errors

### Production Testing:
1. Build for production: `ng build`
2. Deploy to your hosting platform
3. Test the contact form on the live site

## 8. Security Notes
- The public key is safe to expose in frontend code
- EmailJS handles email sending securely
- No sensitive credentials are stored in your frontend
- All email processing happens on EmailJS servers

## 9. Email Plan Limits
- **Free Plan**: 200 emails/month
- **Personal Plan**: $5/month for 1,000 emails
- **Team Plan**: $15/month for 5,000 emails

## 10. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"EmailJS not configured" warning**: Update environment files with real credentials
2. **Form submission fails**: Check service ID, template ID, and public key
3. **Email not received**: Verify destination email and template settings
4. **Console errors**: Check network tab for EmailJS API responses

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit contact form
4. Look for any error messages
5. Check Network tab for failed requests
